# Generalized-Robotic-Injection
This repository provides the necessary drawings, code, and instructions to replicate a 3DOF robotic arm capable of simulated automatic injection. The robot utilizes an IP-Camera and ultrasonic sensor to detect injection sites through the MATLAB Computer Vision Toolbox and a control applet.
